In ad hoc wireless networks, the wireless devices communicate directly with each other without the need for a wireless access point. This mode is similar to a peer-to-peer network topology, where each device connects to each other device in a mesh configuration using radio frequency waves directly between each wireless device’s interface card. This is the wireless equivalent of connecting two workstations together using a crossover cable, thereby eliminating the need for network infrastructure like hubs and switches. \n The second category, infrastructure WLANs, is the version that is most often and widely utilized. When operating in infrastructure mode, the wireless devices communicate to a centralized wireless router or wireless access point, and then use that centralized device to initiate communication with other wireless or wired devices that are also attached to the centralized device. This is the wireless equivalent of connecting multiple workstations to a common hub or switch and utilizing that network device to create communication between the workstations. \n 無線局域網分為兩大類：即席WLAN和基礎設施WLAN。在自組織無線網絡中，無線設備之間直接相互通信，而無需無線接入點。此模式類似於點對點網絡拓撲，其中每個設備在網狀配置中使用直接在每個無線設備的接口卡之間的射頻波連接到另一個設備。這相當於使用交叉電纜將兩個工作站連接在一起的無線方式，從而消除了對集線器和交換機等網絡基礎設施的需求。 \n 第二類是基礎設施WLAN，是最常用和廣泛使用的版本。 當在基礎結構模式下運行時，無線設備與集中式無線路由器或無線接入點進行通信，然後使用該集中式設備啟動與也連接到該集中式設備的其他無線或有線設備的通信。 這相當於將多個工作站連接到公共集線器或交換機，並利用該網絡設備在工作站之間創建通信。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'WLAN Concepts(概念).html'}, {'title': 'Wireless Devices(無線設備)', 'text': 'As previously stated, most wireless networks utilize infrastructure mode and make use of a wireless router or wireless access point to connect the multitude of wireless devices in a given network. A wireless router is used in most small office/home office (SOHO) networks. These devices combine a router, a switch, and a wireless access point and serve as a base station and gateway for the wireless devices. The wireless router allows the wireless devices to communicate with each other using its wireless access point and switch functionality, and then uses its router functionality to connect devices to the remote network: in most cases, the Internet. The wireless router often combines multiple devices into a single, small device. These features include a wireless access point (WAP), a switch, a router, a firewall, and a modem (either cable, fiber, or DSL depending on the Internet service provider). \n Wireless access points, which are integrated into SOHO wireless routers, can also be purchased as standalone units. These are most often seen in corporate environments as part of an enterprise network. A wireless access point enables a wired LAN to communicate with a wireless LAN. The standalone WAP does not interconnect the two networks, though, since it is not a router. A WAP is simply a physical device that converts the radio frequency into 1s and 0s that are easily understood by the physical switch. Note that all wireless devices and the devices on the wired LAN are seen as a single subnet in a standard network. A WAP operates like a hub, broadcasting all the information it receives over the radio frequency waves and relying on the connected devices to only listen to their own traffic. \n \n Kyocera KR1 Mobile EV-DO router.

The freedom of Wi-Fi has become the infrastructure of choice and essentially relegated wired networks more to moving mass data traffic and less user traffic. Although it will not eliminate the wired infrastructure, because Wi-Fi access points need to connect to a wired device using the Ethernet standard, Wi-Fi allows greater expandability and access for IT departments in both corporate and SOHO environments. \n At the time when Wi-Fi became viable for implementation, the wired standard available in most corporate and SOHO networks operated at 100 Mbps. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Committee creates and maintains media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing WLAN computer communication. The IEEE 802.11 standard is overarching guidance that has been provided for the large number of wireless standards. The IEEE Wi-Fi standard is 802.11 with a small letter designation referring to the next revision (e.g., 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ad, etc.). Each standard (like 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n) is differentiated by the frequency range or frequency band that it utilizes. \n The 802.11 standard was initially ratified in 1997 and devices compliant with the 802.11a and 802.11b revisions became commercially available soon after in 2000. Despite higher throughput, 802.11a devices were not as readily adopted as 802.11b devices. At the time Wi-Fi became viable to deploy 802.11b at a maximum throughput of 11 Mbps, wired networks were at a minimum of 100 Mbps in most corporate and SOHO environments. The slower throughput kept users more reliant on traditional desktop machines and less likely to use their new wireless-capable laptops wirelessly. Once 802.11g was sufficiently saturated in the market, the disparity between its 54 Mbps speed and the 100 Mbps speed of wired networks became less noticeable and consumers became more interested in being wireless. The industry continued to push for ways to design higher throughput devices and incorporate the hardware into mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets, and lighter-weight laptops. \n Wireless LANs use two primary frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz range actually encompasses 2.4 to 2.5 GHz frequencies, while the 5 GHz range is 5.75 GHz to 5.875 GHz. Each frequency band has specific channels (or small portions of frequency) at which the devices operate to avoid overlapping with other wireless LAN devices. For 2.4 GHz frequency bands, it is important to choose channels 1, 6, and 11 to avoid overlapping frequencies. This is because overlapping can cause interference in your networks and cause data transmission and receiving issues for the devices. \n 無線（Wi-Fi）網絡速度，廣播流背後的技術以及無線安全性極大地改善了用戶連接性，進而增加了企業和SOHO網絡中諸如智能手機和平板電腦等多功能設備的使用。Wi-Fi的自由度已成為首選的基礎架構，從本質上講，降低了有線網絡的傳輸效率，使之可以移動海量數據流量而減少用戶流量。儘管不會消除有線基礎架構，但由於Wi-Fi接入點需要使用以太網標準連接到有線設備，因此Wi-Fi允許企業和SOHO環境中的IT部門具有更大的可擴展性和訪問權限。 \n Wi-Fi成為可行的實現之時，大多數公司和SOHO網絡中可用的有線標準以100 Mbps的速度運行。 電氣和電子工程師協會（IEEE）標準委員會創建並維護用於實現WLAN計算機通信的媒體訪問控制（MAC）和物理層（PHY）規範。 IEEE 802.11標準是為大量無線標準提供的總體指導。 IEEE Wi-Fi標準是802.11，帶有小寫字母，表示下一個修訂版本（例如802.11n，802.11ac，802.11ad等）。 每個標準（如802.11a，802.11b，802.11g或802.11n）都根據其使用的頻率範圍或頻帶進行區分。 \n 802.11標準最初是在1997年批准的，並且與802.11a和802.11b修訂版兼容的設備在2000年之後很快就可以商業化使用。儘管吞吐量更高，但是802.11a設備不如802.11b設備那樣容易採用。 當Wi-Fi能夠以11 Mbps的最大吞吐量部署802.11b時，在大多數公司和SOHO環境中，有線網絡的最低速度為100 Mbps。 較低的吞吐量使用戶更依賴於傳統台式機，並且不太可能無線使用其具有無線功能的新型筆記本電腦。 一旦802.11g在市場上充分飽和，其54 Mbps速度與100 Mbps有線網絡速度之間的差異就變得不那麼明顯了，消費者對無線變得越來越感興趣。 \n 無線局域網使用兩個主要頻段：2.4 GHz和5 GHz。 2.4 GHz範圍實際上包含2.4至2.5 GHz頻率，而5 GHz範圍是5.75 GHz至5.875 GHz。 每個頻帶具有設備在其上操作的特定信道（或頻率的一小部分），以避免與其他無線LAN設備重疊。 對於2.4 GHz頻帶，重要的是選擇信道1、6和11，以避免頻率重疊。 這是因為重疊會導致網絡干擾，並導致設備的數據傳輸和接收問題。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Background and History(背景和歷史).html'}, {'title': 'Speed, Range, and Frequencies(速度，範圍和頻率)', 'text': "\n \n Bandwidth speed has been greatly improved through the revisions after 802.11b, as shown in the table below. When discussing data flow and speed, the two terms referred to are bandwidth and throughput. Though they are often used interchangeably, the two terms are different and need to be understood. Simply put, bandwidth is the theoretical maximum of the given standard, whereas throughput is the actual potential in a real-world scenario. Many factors affect actual throughput, such as frequency, channel overlap, and broadcast streams. \n \n \n \n Revision \n (Max) Bandwidth \n Frequency \n \n \n 802.11a \n 54 Mbps \n 3.7/5.0 \n \n \n 802.11b \n 11 Mbps \n 2.4 \n \n \n 802.11g \n 54 Mbps \n 2.4 \n \n \n 802.11n \n 300/600 Mbps \n 2.4/5.0 \n \n \n 802.11ac \n 1700+ Gbps \n 5.0 \n \n \n \n The four wireless standards that are important to focus your studies on are 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps, and has a range of up to 35 meters indoors and 120 meters outdoors. 802.11b operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 11 Mbps, and has a range of up to 32 meters indoors and 140 meters outdoors. 802.11g operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps, and has a range of up to 32 meters indoors and 140 meters outdoors. 802.11n features a dual-band transceiver, operating in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, has a maximum bandwidth of more than 300 Mbps, and has a range of up to 70 meters indoors and 250 meters outdoors. \n The 2.4 GHz frequency band is more robust than the 5.0 GHz in that it is less susceptible to interference and has a wider distance range. However, many more devices such as RC toys, cordless telephones, other radio devices such as mice and keyboards, and microwave ovens also operate in the 2.4 GHz frequency, so it is more crowded, which can have a negative impact on throughput. Although the 5.0 GHz frequency band is less crowded, it is more susceptible to obstructions such as building infrastructure (i.e., walls, floors, steel beams, etc.) due to absorption. \n Beginning with the 802.11n standard and subsequently moving to the current 802.11ac standard, manufacturers incorporated multiple antennae to achieve higher throughput. Known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), both revisions accomplish the higher throughput by allowing operation at two different channel widths (20 and 40 MHz) within the same frequency and operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequency bands at the same time. Wireless N (802.11n) and wireless AC have a much larger bandwidth and maximum range, because they use MIMO and multiple frequency bands working in tandem to increase transmission and reception. \n An important note is that wireless N, G, and B are all compatible because they all support the 2.4 GHz frequency, allowing for backward compatibility. If you use multiple standards, like B, G, and N devices at the same time on a singular wireless N wireless access point, the WAP will default back to wireless B standards to support each device, which will significantly slow down the network.

There are many sources of interference in the 2.4 GHz range, which is one reason that wireless N and newer networks have switched to the 5 GHz frequency band. The frequency interference can be caused by other WLAN devices, such as having numerous WLANs in a single building and each WAP using the same channel or channels close in number (like channel 1 and 2, or 1 and 3). To prevent this, 2.4 GHz standard wireless devices should operate in channels separated by multiple channels, such as using channels 1, 6, and 11. \n Cordless phones, baby monitors, microwave ovens, wireless security systems, and other cordless electronics generally use the 2.4 GHz range, as well, so if you have many of those devices near your network, you may wish to upgrade to wireless N (5 GHz) to avoid interference. Physical obstacles, such as walls, appliances, cabinets, and other dense objects can also block the radio wave propagation, causing weak signals and network interference. Finally, the cause of interference could be that the originating signal is too weak, and some wireless access points allow you to increase the transmission power to overcome this type of interference. \n 由於其他設備使用與WLAN設備相同頻帶的頻率，因此無線網絡會受到射頻干擾（RFI）。在2.4 GHz範圍內有許多干擾源，這是無線N和較新網絡已切換到5 GHz頻帶的原因之一。頻率干擾可能是由其他WLAN設備引起的，例如在同一建築物中具有多個WLAN，並且每個WAP使用的通道數量相同（或通道1和2，或通道1和3）相同。為避免這種情況，2.4 GHz標準無線設備應在由多個通道分隔的通道中運行，例如使用通道1、6和11。 \n 無繩電話，嬰兒監視器，微波爐，無線安全系統和其他無繩電子設備通常也使用2.4 GHz範圍，因此，如果網絡中有許多此類設備，則可能希望升級到無線N（5 GHz ），以避免干擾。 牆壁，電器，機櫃和其他密集物體等物理障礙物也會阻擋無線電波的傳播，從而導致信號微弱和網絡干擾。 最後，造成乾擾的原因可能是始發信號太弱，某些無線接入點使您可以增加傳輸功率以克服這種類型的干擾。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Sources of Interference(干擾源).html'}, {'title': 'Privacy and Security(隱私和安全)', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Privacy and Security(隱私和安全).html'}, {'title': '1-1', 'text': '\n Due to the nature of Wi-Fi being transmitted through radio frequencies, the data transferred is susceptible to being viewed and captured by any other radio receiver.

This wireless connection was secured using encryption with a 40-bit WEP key that all access points and client devices would use (preshared key). This symmetric encryption was a good idea, but since the key was so small (40 bits), it was quickly broken by attackers. \n To solve this, WEP evolved into using a 64-bit key and could support keys up to 128 bits, which would provide strong encryption. Unfortunately, the WEP algorithm used for encryption also relied on using an initialization vector (IV) in combination with the preshared key to create the strong encryption, but the IV was only created at 24 bits and is sent in plain text or clear text during the preshared key exchange. This was quickly compromised by attackers using a brute-force attack to determine the password using the weak IV. Many utilities exist in the open-source realm that can crack WEP passwords within just a few minutes on modern hardware. For this reason, WEP is considered insecure today and should never be used in your networks. \n 在原始802.11標準中，唯一提供的安全性是WEP，它聲稱與有線網絡連接一樣安全。通過使用所有訪問點和客戶端設備都將使用的40位WEP密鑰（預共享密鑰）進行加密來保護此無線連接。這種對稱加密是一個好主意，但是由於密鑰很小（40位），因此攻擊者很快就將其破壞了。 \n 為了解決這個問題，WEP演變為使用64位密鑰，並且可以支持高達128位的密鑰，從而可以提供強大的加密功能。 不幸的是，用於加密的WEP算法還依賴於使用初始化向量（IV）結合預共享密鑰來創建強加密，但是IV僅以24位創建，並且在加密期間以純文本或明文發送。預共享密鑰交換。 攻擊者使用強力攻擊使用弱IV來確定密碼，從而很快破壞了這一安全性。 開源領域中存在許多實用程序，可以在短短幾分鐘內在現代硬件上破解WEP密碼。 因此，WEP在今天被認為是不安全的，永遠不要在您的網絡中使用。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) (有線等效保密（WEP）).html'}, {'title': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)(Wi-Fi保護訪問（WPA）)', 'text': 'The WPA standard was introduced to replace the insecure WEP. WPA used a 48-bit IV in place of WEP’s 24-bit IV. This upgraded IV uses a temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP). TKIP is an IEEE standard that was designed to provide more secure encryption. TKIP is a suite of algorithms that allows WLAN equipment to upgrade to TKIP without replacing hardware. TKIP encrypts each data packet with a unique encryption key, and the keys are much stronger than WEP. To increase key strength, TKIP includes four additional algorithms. \n In addition to TKIP, the WPA standard uses message integrity check (MIC) to confirm that data was not modified in transit. MIC uses a “hash” to verify that a message has not been altered. WPA supported both preshared key mode and enterprise mode. In enterprise mode, users are required to authenticate before exchanging their keys and each key between the client and access point is only temporary, reducing the chance of compromise. Unfortunately, WPA also suffered security flaws centered on the use of passphrases and pre-shared key (PSK) management and is now also considered to be unsecure. \n 引入了WPA標準來代替不安全的WEP。WPA使用48位IV代替WEP的24位IV。此升級的IV使用臨時密鑰完整性協議（TKIP）。TKIP是旨在提供更安全的加密的IEEE標準。TKIP是一套算法，可以使WLAN設備升級到TKIP，而無需更換硬件。TKIP使用唯一的加密密鑰加密每個數據包，並且該密鑰比WEP強得多。為了增強按鍵強度，TKIP包括四個附加算法。 \n 除了TKIP，WPA標準還使用消息完整性檢查（MIC）來確認數據在傳輸過程中沒有被修改。MIC使用“哈希”來驗證消息是否未被更改。WPA支持預共享密鑰模式和企業模式。在企業模式下，要求用戶在交換密鑰之前進行身份驗證，並且客戶端和訪問點之間的每個密鑰只是臨時的，從而減少了洩露的機會。不幸的是，WPA還遭受了圍繞密碼短語和預共享密鑰（PSK）管理的安全缺陷，現在也被認為是不安全的。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)(Wi-Fi保護訪問（WPA）).html'}, {'title': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)(Wi-Fi保護訪問2（WPA2）)', 'text': 'Wi-Fi protected access version 2 (WPA2) was implemented to replace both WEP and WPA because of the insecurities with the 24-bit and 48-bit initialization vectors.

Additionally, the encryption used for WPA2 is the advanced encryption standard (AES) with a 128-bit key, the same algorithm used by the United States government to protect their classified networks. Using WPA2 creates a secure wireless network, but only when used with good passwords and shared keys. WPA2 also supports enterprise mode for centralized user authentication (used in corporate networks) and a personal mode for preshared key support (used in most homes and small offices). The key to security with WPA2 is a strong password, since the current method of breaking into a WPA2 network is to use brute force attacks against the preshared key.

Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this \xa0 in one line of Python \xa0 using at least one list comprehension . ( Hint: Remember \xa0 list comprehensions \xa0 from Exercise 7 ). \n The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python, but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do without using \xa0 set s that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can either choose to use the original directive and read about the \xa0 set \xa0 command in Python 3.3 , or try to implement this on your own and use at least one list comprehension in the solution. \n Extra: \n \n Randomly generate two lists to test this \n \nDiscussion\n Concepts for this week: \n \n List comprehensions \n Random numbers, continued \n \nList comprehensions\n We already discussed list comprehensions in \xa0 Exercise 7 , but they can be made much more complicated. \n For example: \n \n \t x   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ] \n\t y   =   [ 5 ,   10 ,   15 ] \n\t allproducts   =   [ a * b   for   a   in   x   for   b   in   y ] \n \n At the end of this piece of code, \xa0 allproducts \xa0 will contain the list \xa0 [5, 10, 15, 10, 20, 30, 15, 30, 45] . So you can put multiple for loops inside the comprehension. But you can also add more complicated conditionals: \n \n \t x   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ] \n\t y   =   [ 5 ,   10 ,   15 ] \n\t customlist   =   [ a * b   for   a   in   x   for   b   in   y   if   a * b % 2   !=   0 ] \n \n Now \xa0 customlist \xa0 contains \xa0 [5, 15, 15, 45] \xa0 because only the odd products are added to the list. \n In general, the list comprehension takes the form: \n \n \t [ EXPRESSION   FOR_LOOPS   CONDITIONALS ] \n \n as shown in the examples above. \nRandom numbers, continued\n Try to use the \xa0 Python random documentation \xa0 to figure out how to generate a random list. As a hint look below: \n \n \t a   =   random . sample ( range ( 100 ),   5 ) \n \n This line of code will leave \xa0 a \xa0 containing a list of 5 random numbers from 0 to 99. \n列表重疊理解 練習10（和 解決方案 ） \n 本週的練習將重溫舊的練習（請參閱 練習5 ），只是需要以其他方式解決。 \n 拿兩個列表，舉例來說，這兩個： \n \n \t a   =   [ 1 ,   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   5 ,   8 ,   13 ,   21 ,   34 ,   55 ,   89 ] \n\t b   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   5 ,   6 ,   7 ,   8 ,   9 ,   10 ,   11 ,   12 ,   13 ] \n \n 並編寫一個程序，該程序返回一個列表，該列表僅包含列表之間的公共元素（無重複項）。 確保您的程序可以在兩個不同大小的列表上運行。 使用至少一個列表理解 語句在一行Python中 \xa0 編寫 。 （ 提示：記住 練習7中的 列表理解 ）。 \n 此練習的原始表述是使用一行Python編寫解決方案，但是一些讀者指出，如果不使用 set 我尚未在博客上討論過的s， 則不可能做到這一點 ，因此您可以選擇使用原始指令，並閱讀 set Python 3.3中 的 命令 ，或者嘗試自己實現該 指令並 在解決方案中至少使用一個列表理解。 \n 額外： \n \n 隨機生成兩個列表進行測試 \n \n 討論區 \n 本週的概念： \n \n 清單理解 \n 隨機數，續 \n \n 清單理解 \n 我們已經在 練習7中 討論了列表理解 ，但是可以使它們複雜得多。 \n 例如： \n \n \t x   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ] \n\t y   =   [ 5 ,   10 ,   15 ] \n\t allproducts   =   [ a * b   for   a   in   x   for   b   in   y ] \n \n 在這段代碼的最後， allproducts 將包含list \xa0 [5, 10, 15, 10, 20, 30, 15, 30, 45] 。 因此，您可以在理解中放入多個for循環。 但是您還可以添加更複雜的條件： \n \n \t x   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ] \n\t y   =   [ 5 ,   10 ,   15 ] \n\t customlist   =   [ a * b   for   a   in   x   for   b   in   y   if   a * b % 2   !=   0 ] \n \n 現在 customlist 包含， [5, 15, 15, 45] 因為僅將奇數產品添加到列表中。 \n 通常，列表理解採用以下形式： \n \n \t [ EXPRESSION   FOR_LOOPS   CONDITIONALS ] \n \n 如以上示例所示。 \n 隨機數，續 \n 嘗試使用 Python隨機文檔 來弄清楚如何生成隨機列表。 提示如下： \n \n \t a   =   random . sample ( range ( 100 ),   5 ) \n \n 這行代碼將 a 包含從0到99的5個隨機數的列表。 \n回顧\n 函數的作用是包裝我們要重用的一段代碼，對其進行標記，並允許我們相對容易地再次使用它。 您可以將變量添加到函數中，以使代碼更加可重用，並且可以將默認參數添加到這些變量中。 \n 一開始處理函數有點奇怪，但是一旦掌握了這些函數，它們將成為編程的救星。 此外，學習編程的重點是抽象，解決問題，分解問題，而這正是功能的全部所在。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P10.html'}, {'title': 'P11', 'text': 'check primality functions Exercise 11 (and \xa0 Solution )\n Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your answer to \xa0 Exercise 4 \xa0 to help you. Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below. \nDiscussion\n Concepts for this week: \n \n Functions \n Reusable functions \n Default arguments \n \nFunctions\n One of the tools programming gives us is the ability to break down problems into easier (or perhaps previously solved) or reusable subproblems. It is good practice to have a function have a single purpose, and the name of that function should hint at it’s purpose in some way. \n Most programming languages have this idea of a function, subroutine, or subprogram. In Python, a function is a programming construct that allows exactly that. \n Let’s look at a simple example: \n \n    def   get_integer (): \n     return   int ( input ( "Give me a number: " )) \n \n In this small example, we used the same code that asks a user for input as a tabbed line underneath this \xa0 def \xa0 statement. The \xa0 def \xa0 means that everything tabbed underneath is a function. The name \xa0 get_integer() \xa0 is just a name that I (the programmer) made up. If I just include this code inside a Python file and run it, nothing will happen - all I have done so far is wrapped my code inside of a function; I never told my program to actually RUN my function. \n \n    def   get_integer (): \n     return   int ( input ( "Give me a number: " )) \n\n   age   =   get_integer () \n   school_year   =   get_integer () \n   if   age   >   15 : \n     print ( "You are over the age of 15" ) \n   print ( "You are in grade "   +   str ( school_year )) \n \n What I have done here is \xa0 called \xa0 the function (told it to run) by writing \xa0 age = get_integer() . When this line of code runs, what happens is the program will \xa0 execute \xa0 (run) the function by asking me for a number, then \xa0 returning \xa0 it (giving it back to me) by saving it inside the variable \xa0 age . Now when I want to ask the user for another number (this time representing the school year), I do the same thing with the variable \xa0 school_year . \nReusable functions\n This is all well and good, but I can make my function do much more for me. Right now, my function will always ask the user for a number by printing the string \xa0 "Give me a number: " . What if I want to print a different string every time I ask the user for a number, but otherwise use the same idea for the function? In other words, I want a variable parameter in my function that changes every time I call the function based on something I (the programmer) want to be different. \n I can do this by \xa0 passing \xa0 (giving) my function a variable. Like this: \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n \n Now what I can do when I call the function is something like this: \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n\n   age   =   get_integer ( "Tell me your age: " ) \n   school_year   =   get_integer ( "What grade are you in? " ) \n   if   age   >   15 : \n     print ( "You are over the age of 15" ) \n   print ( "You are in grade "   +   str ( school_year )) \n \n Now it is easier for a user to use the program, because the help text is different. \n These variables you pass to functions are called \xa0 variables , \xa0 parameters , or \xa0 arguments . \nDefault arguments\n In the example above, once I have added an \xa0 argument \xa0 to my function, I always have to give an argument when I call the function. I can’t forget to give the \xa0 get_integer() \xa0 function from above a string to print to the screen. In some cases, I want there to be a “default” behavior for my function that happens when I create an argument for it but don’t give it any. \n In the example above, if I don’t give a custom string (which may be 95% of the time I use this function), I just want the \xa0 input() \xa0 line to say \xa0 "Give me a number: " \xa0 and I want to save myself the trouble of writing this every single time I call the function. So what I can do is give my function \xa0 default arguments . Like so: \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text = "Give me a number: " ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n \n What happens now is I can use the function in two ways: by giving it an argument and by NOT giving it an argument. \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text = "Give me a number: " ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n\n   age   =   get_integer ( "Tell me your age: " ) \n   school_year   =   get_integer () \n   if   age   >   15 : \n     print ( "You are over the age of 15" ) \n   print ( "You are in grade "   +   str ( school_year )) \n \n The first time I call the function, it will print \xa0 "Tell me your age: " , but the second time, it will print \xa0 "Give me a number: " , because I did not give it a string and it will execute the default behavior. \nRecap\n What a function does is wrap a piece of code that we want to reuse, labels it, and allows us to use it again relatively easily. You can add variables to the functions to make your code even MORE reusable, and you can add default arguments to these variables. \n Functions are a bit strange to deal with at first, but once you master them, they will be your savior in programming. Besides, the whole point of learning programming is abstraction, problem solving, breaking down problems, and that’s exactly what functions are all about. \n檢查基本功能\n 練習11（和 解決方案 ） \n 向用戶詢問一個數字，並確定該數字是否為質數。 （對於那些忘記的人，質數是沒有除數的數。） 您可以（並且應該！）使用 練習4 的答案 來幫助您。 藉此機會練習使用如下所述的功能。 \n 討論區 \n 本週的概念： \n \n 職能 \n 可重用功能 \n 默認參數 \n 職能 \n \n 編程提供給我們的工具之一是能夠將問題分解為更簡單（或可能先前解決）或可重用的子問題。 優良作法是使一個函數具有單一目的，並且該函數的名稱應以某種方式暗示其目的。 \n 大多數編程語言都具有函數，子例程或子程序的概念。 在Python中，函數是一種允許這樣做的編程構造。 \n 讓我們看一個簡單的例子： \n \n    def   get_integer (): \n     return   int ( input ( "Give me a number: " )) \n \n 在這個小示例中，我們使用了相同的代碼來要求用戶輸入此 def 語句 下方的選項卡行 。 的 def 手段，一切選項卡式下面是一個函數。 這個名字 get_integer() 只是我（程序員）組成的名字。 如果我只是將此代碼包含在Python文件中並運行它，則將不會發生任何事情-到目前為止，我所做的一切都將我的代碼包裝在一個函數中； 我從未告訴過我的程序實際運行我的功能。 \n \n    def   get_integer (): \n     return   int ( input ( "Give me a number: " )) \n \n   age   =   get_integer () \n   school_year   =   get_integer () \n   if   age   >   15 : \n     print ( "You are over the age of 15" ) \n   print ( "You are in grade "   +   str ( school_year )) \n \n 我在這裡所做的事情 通過編寫 稱為 函數（告訴它運行） age = get_integer() 。 當這行代碼運行時，程序將 通過詢問我一個數字 來 執行 （運行）該函數，然後 將 其保存在變量中以將其 返回 （返還給我） age 。 現在，當我想問用戶另一個數字（這次代表學年）時，我對變量做了同樣的事情 school_year 。 \n 可重用功能 \n 這一切都很好，但是我可以讓我的功能為我做更多的事情。 現在，我的函數將始終通過打印字符串向用戶詢問一個數字 "Give me a number: " 。 如果我想每次問用戶一個數字時都想打印一個不同的字符串，但對於該函數使用相同的想法怎麼辦？ 換句話說，我希望函數中的變量參數在每次調用函數時都根據我（程序員）希望與眾不同的事物而改變。 \n 我可以通過 傳遞 （給我的）函數一個變量 來做到這一點 。 像這樣： \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n \n 現在，我在調用該函數時可以執行的操作如下： \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n \n   age   =   get_integer ( "Tell me your age: " ) \n   school_year   =   get_integer ( "What grade are you in? " ) \n   if   age   >   15 : \n     print ( "You are over the age of 15" ) \n   print ( "You are in grade "   +   str ( school_year )) \n \n 現在，由於幫助文本不同，因此使用戶更容易使用該程序。 \n 傳遞給函數的這些變量稱為 變量 ， 參數 或 參數 。 \n 默認參數 \n 在上面的示例中，在 向函數 添加 參數後 ，在調用函數時始終必須提供參數。 我不能忘記 get_integer() 從字符串上方 給 函數打印到屏幕上。 在某些情況下，我希望函數有一種“默認”行為，這種行為會在為它創建參數但不給出任何參數時發生。 \n 在上面的示例中，如果我不提供自定義字符串（可能占我使用此函數的時間的95％），我只想讓 input() 行說出來， "Give me a number: " 並且省去了每次編寫此 字符串 的麻煩我稱這個功能。 所以我能做的就是給我的函數 默認參數 。 像這樣： \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text = "Give me a number: " ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n \n 現在發生的事情是我可以通過兩種方式使用該函數：通過給它一個參數和不給它一個參數。 \n \n    def   get_integer ( help_text = "Give me a number: " ): \n     return   int ( input ( help_text )) \n \n   age   =   get_integer ( "Tell me your age: " ) \n   school_year   =   get_integer () \n   if   age   >   15 : \n     print ( "You are over the age of 15" ) \n   print ( "You are in grade "   +   str ( school_year )) \n \n 第一次調用該函數，它將打印 "Tell me your age: " ，但是第二次，它將打印 "Give me a number: " ，因為我沒有給它一個字符串，它將執行默認行為。 \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P11.html'}, {'title': 'P12', 'text': 'List ends \n Exercise 12 (and \xa0 Solution )\n Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, \xa0 a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] ) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.

The problem is this: the proposed reader solution (and the solution that I had in mind myself) as written above does not take into account the fact that there might be duplicates in the resulting list, where I specifically asked to not include duplicates. This means that in the simple example I gave above, \xa0 a ’s first element is \xa0 1 \xa0 will be added to the \xa0 result \xa0 list because it is in \xa0 b . But then it’s next element is also \xa0 1 , and is also in \xa0 b , so will be added to the \xa0 result \xa0 list. So the solution as given (the comprehension \xa0 [i for i in a if i in b] ) will not yield the correct result on the example solution. \n Instead, as pointed out by Gautam and Jeff, the simplest way to achieve this solution would be to make sure that we are only looking at unique elements from \xa0 a , the first list in the comprehension.

We have not discussed doing this easily in Python on this blog using the \xa0 set \xa0 built-in function, but if you know it, the solution will look like this: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n import \xa0 random \n \n \n \n a \xa0 = \xa0 random . sample ( range ( 1 , 30 ), \xa0 12 ) \n \n \n \n b \xa0 = \xa0 random . sample ( range ( 1 , 30 ), \xa0 16 ) \n \n \n \n result \xa0 = \xa0 [ i \xa0 for \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 set ( a ) \xa0 if \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 b ] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n view raw list-overlap-comprehensions.py \xa0 hosted with ❤ by \xa0 GitHub \n \n \n But, to achieve the same results as asked in the original question while still using a list comprehension (however, definitely not using a single line of code), would be to make sure that there is no overlap in the new list after it is constructed, using the traditional \xa0 for \xa0 loop on lists: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n import \xa0 random \n \n \n \n a \xa0 = \xa0 random . sample ( range ( 1 , 30 ), \xa0 12 ) \n \n \n \n b \xa0 = \xa0 random . sample ( range ( 1 , 30 ), \xa0 16 ) \n \n \n \n result_overlap \xa0 = \xa0 [ i \xa0 for \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 set ( a ) \xa0 if \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 b ] \n \n \n \n result \xa0 = \xa0 [] \n \n \n \n for \xa0 element \xa0 in \xa0 result_overlap : \n \n \n \n if \xa0 element \xa0 not \xa0 in \xa0 result : \n \n \n \n result . appent ( element ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n view raw list-overlap-comprehensions-for.py \xa0 hosted with ❤ by \xa0 GitHub \n \n \n Or, to practice list comprehensions again, this can be done with two list comprehensions: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n import \xa0 random \n \n \n \n a \xa0 = \xa0 random . sample ( range ( 1 , 30 ), \xa0 12 ) \n \n \n \n b \xa0 = \xa0 random . sample ( range ( 1 , 30 ), \xa0 16 ) \n \n \n \n result_overlaps \xa0 = \xa0 [ i \xa0 for \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 set ( a ) \xa0 if \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 b ] \n \n \n \n result \xa0 = \xa0 [ i \xa0 for \xa0 i \xa0 in \xa0 result_overlaps \xa0 if \xa0 result_overlaps . count ( i ) \xa0 == \xa0 1 ] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n view raw \n \n \n 練習10 \n 本週的練習將重溫舊的練習（請參閱 練習5 ），只是需要以其他方式解決。 \n 拿兩個列表，舉例來說，這兩個： \n \n \t a   =   [ 1 ,   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   5 ,   8 ,   13 ,   21 ,   34 ,   55 ,   89 ] \n\t b   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   5 ,   6 ,   7 ,   8 ,   9 ,   10 ,   11 ,   12 ,   13 ] \n \n 並編寫一個程序，該程序返回一個列表，該列表僅包含列表之間的公共元素（無重複項）。 確保您的程序可以在兩個不同大小的列表上運行。 至少使用一個列表理解來 寫這個 。 （ 提示：記住 練習7中的 列表理解 ）。 \n 額外： \n \n 隨機生成兩個列表進行測試 \n \n 樣品溶液 \n 用戶提交的解決方案： \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 隨機導入 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 一個= random.sample（range（1,30），12） \n \n \n \n b = random.sample（範圍（1,30），16） \n \n \n \n 結果= [如果b中有i，則a中的i代表i] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 查看原始 練習10 \xa0 由 GitHub託管 \n \n \n 正如該博客的一些評論者/讀者所指出的（主要感謝Gautam和Jeff），所提出的練習實際上不可能用Python編寫。 問題是這樣的：上面寫的建議的閱讀器解決方案（以及我自己想到的解決方案）沒有考慮到結果列表中可能存在重複項的事實，我特別要求不要包含重複項。 這意味著在我上面給出的簡單示例中， a 第一個元素 1 將被添加到 result 列表中，因為它在中 b 。 但隨後它的下一個元素也是 1 ，並且也在 b ，因此將被添加到 result 列表中。 因此，給定的解決方案（comprehension \xa0 [i for i in a if i in b] ）將無法在示例解決方案上產生正確的結果。 \n 相反，正如Gautam和Jeff所指出的那樣，實現此解決方案的最簡單方法是確保僅查看來自 a 理解中第一個列表的 唯一元素 。 我們沒有在此博客上使用 set 內置函數 討論在Python中輕鬆實現此操作的 方法，但是如果您知道，解決方案將如下所示： \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 隨機 導入 \n \n \n \n a \xa0 = \xa0 隨機的 。 樣品 （ 範圍 （ 1 ， 30 ）， 12 ） \n \n \n \n b \xa0 = \xa0 隨機 。 樣品 （ 範圍 （ 1 ， 30 ）， 16 ） \n \n \n \n 導致 \xa0 = \xa0 [ 我 \xa0 為 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 集 （ 一 ） 如果 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 b \xa0 ] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 查看原始 list-overlap-comprehensions.py \xa0 託管與❤通過 GitHub上 \n \n \n 但是，要在仍然使用列表理解的情況下達到與原始問題相同的結果（但是，絕對不要使用一行代碼），將確保新列表在構建後沒有重疊，使用 for 列表上 的傳統 循環： \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 隨機 導入 \n \n \n \n a \xa0 = \xa0 隨機的 。 樣品 （ 範圍 （ 1 ， 30 ）， 12 ） \n \n \n \n b \xa0 = \xa0 隨機 。 樣品 （ 範圍 （ 1 ， 30 ）， 16 ） \n \n \n \n result_overlap \xa0 = \xa0 [ 我 \xa0 為 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 集 （ 一 ） 如果 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 b \xa0 ] \n \n \n \n 結果 \xa0 = \xa0 [] \n \n \n \n 對於 \xa0 元件 \xa0 在 \xa0 result_overlap ： \n \n \n \n 如果 \xa0 要素 \xa0 不能 \xa0 在 \xa0 結果 ： \n \n \n \n 結果 。 出現 （ 元素 ） \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 查看原始 list-overlap-comprehensions-for.py \xa0 託管與❤通過 GitHub上 \n \n \n 或者，要再次練習列表推導，可以使用兩個列表推導來完成： \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 隨機 導入 \n \n \n \n a \xa0 = \xa0 隨機的 。 樣品 （ 範圍 （ 1 ， 30 ）， 12 ） \n \n \n \n b \xa0 = \xa0 隨機 。 樣品 （ 範圍 （ 1 ， 30 ）， 16 ） \n \n \n \n result_overlaps \xa0 = \xa0 [ 我 \xa0 為 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 集 （ 一 ） 如果 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 b \xa0 ] \n \n \n \n 導致 \xa0 = \xa0 [ 我 \xa0 為 \xa0 我 \xa0 在 \xa0 result_overlaps \xa0 如果 \xa0 result_overlaps 。 數 （ i ） == \xa0 1 \xa0 ] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P10 All solutions.html'}, {'title': 'P11 All solutions', 'text': 'Check Primality Functions Solutions \n \n Exercise 11 \n Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.

This is because the pair of numbers that are both the largest factors of the number are \xa0 square root of x \xa0 and \xa0 square root of x .

We will talk about this in a future exercise. \n \n Share the fun! \n 練習13\n編寫一個程序，詢問用戶要生成多少斐波那契數，然後生成它們。藉此機會考慮如何使用功能。確保要求用戶輸入要生成的序列中的數字。（提示：斐波那契序列是一個數字序列，其中序列中的下一個數字是序列中前兩個數字的和。該序列看起來像這樣：1、1、2、3、5、8、13…）\n\n 樣品溶液 \n您可以通過多種方式使用函數來生成斐波那契數。這是用戶提交的一種解決方案：\n\ndef gen_fib（）：\n    count = int（input（“您要生成多少斐波那契數字？”）\n    我= 1\n    如果count == 0：\n        fib = []\n    小數計數== 1：\n        fib = [1]\n    elif count == 2：\n        fib = [1,1]\n    小數> 2：\n        fib = [1,1]\n        而我<（計數-1）：\n            fib.append（fib [i] + fib [i-1]）\n            我+ = 1\n\n    退貨\n        \n    \n查看GitHub託管於❤的rawgistfile1.txt\n還有一個：\n\ndef fibonacci（）：\n    num = int（input（“生成多少個數字？：”））\n    我= 1\n    如果num == 0：\n        fib = []\n    elif num == 1：\n        fib = [1]\n    elif num == 2：\n        fib = [1,1]\n    小數> 2：\n        fib = [1,1]\n        而我<（數字-1）：\n            fib.append（fib [i] + fib [i-1]）\n            我+ = 1\n    退貨\n打印（fibonacci（））\n輸入（）\n查看GitHub託管的❤的rawpractice13.py\n該解決方案使用了所謂的計算斐波納契數的“迭代”方法。這意味著您使用某種循環來將數字加在一起以獲得下一個數字。\n\n計算斐波那契數的另一種方法是使用遞歸，或以一種特殊方式一遍又一遍地調用相同的函數來計算斐波那契數。我們將在以後的練習中討論這一點。\n\n分享樂趣！ \n \n \n Exercise 13 (and\xa0Solution) \n Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.( Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, … ) \n Discussion \n Practice functions! \n Happy coding! 練習13（和解決方案） \n 編寫一個程序，詢問用戶要生成多少斐波那契數字，然後生成它們。藉此機會考慮如何使用功能。確保要求用戶輸入要生成的序列中的數字。（提示：Fibonnaci序列是一個數字序列，其中序列中的下一個數字是序列中前兩個數字的和。該序列看起來像這樣：1、1、2、3、5、8、13…） \n 討論區 \n 練習功能！ \n 祝您編碼愉快！ \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P13All solutions.html'}, {'title': '教學歷程', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '教學歷程.html'}, {'title': 'W1', 'text': '1.照號碼編排座位\n 2.網路的一些性質及介紹等(proxy,ipv6,ipv4等)2 1.建立 Github, Gitlab, Heroku 與 Authorea 帳號 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W1.html'}, {'title': 'W2', 'text': '1.建立 Github, Gitlab, Heroku 與 Authorea 帳號 2.學員利用 Github Pages 與 CMSiMDE 建立個人網頁 \n \n 3.登陸學號@gm填寫基本資料 \n \n \n 下載可攜 Python 套件 在電腦輔助設計室可以利用 IPv6 協定至 http://a.kmol.info:88 下載課程相關檔案. 下載 fall2020_cp.7z 壓縮檔案之後, 直接利用 7zip 解開壓縮, 然後在 64 位元 Windows 10 啟動 start.bat, 就可以直接在 SciTE 編輯器中解譯 Python 程式, 而且可以利用 pip 工具安裝所需的 Python 模組之後, 接下來必須: 了解如何自己建立與 fall2020_cp.7z 相同功能的可攜 Python 套件 了解如何在可攜套件中加入 portablegit, sharex, putty 等工具, 並學習如何使用 了解如何在 github 以 submodule (或不以 submodule) 建立 cmsimde 倉儲 了解如何在近端維護 CMSiMDE 內容管理系統 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W2.html'}, {'title': 'W3', 'text': '\n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W3.html'}, {'title': '英文搶救計畫', 'text': "\n 曾經錯過沒有關係, 但若因為終身菜英文而錯失美好未來, 著實可惜. 解救菜英文就從現在開始. \n 先從 最常用的 2000 個英文字彙 開始. \n 國中英語字彙 \xa0 2000 字 \n 普通高中 4500 -7000 字 \n 技職與綜合高中 4000 - \xa0 5500 字 \n 自行寫程式兼學英文字彙: \n 假如能夠配合\xa0 https://github.com/mdecourse/lookupdict \xa0 從 Webster 英英字典中整理出 \xa0 5500 字 \xa0 的英文說明, 並逐字研讀, 應該是解救菜英文最佳手段. \n 使用電腦學習英文字彙: \n 另一項學習英文字彙的方式則是利用電腦或筆電下載安裝 \xa0 Anki , 然後導入 \xa0 4000 英文單字 學習模組, 就可以開始學習了.
