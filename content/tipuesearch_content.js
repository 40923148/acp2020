In ad hoc wireless networks, the wireless devices communicate directly with each other without the need for a wireless access point. This mode is similar to a peer-to-peer network topology, where each device connects to each other device in a mesh configuration using radio frequency waves directly between each wireless device’s interface card. This is the wireless equivalent of connecting two workstations together using a crossover cable, thereby eliminating the need for network infrastructure like hubs and switches. \n The second category, infrastructure WLANs, is the version that is most often and widely utilized. When operating in infrastructure mode, the wireless devices communicate to a centralized wireless router or wireless access point, and then use that centralized device to initiate communication with other wireless or wired devices that are also attached to the centralized device. This is the wireless equivalent of connecting multiple workstations to a common hub or switch and utilizing that network device to create communication between the workstations. \n 無線局域網分為兩大類：即席WLAN和基礎設施WLAN。在自組織無線網絡中，無線設備之間直接相互通信，而無需無線接入點。此模式類似於點對點網絡拓撲，其中每個設備在網狀配置中使用直接在每個無線設備的接口卡之間的射頻波連接到另一個設備。這相當於使用交叉電纜將兩個工作站連接在一起的無線方式，從而消除了對集線器和交換機等網絡基礎設施的需求。 \n 第二類是基礎設施WLAN，是最常用和廣泛使用的版本。 當在基礎結構模式下運行時，無線設備與集中式無線路由器或無線接入點進行通信，然後使用該集中式設備啟動與也連接到該集中式設備的其他無線或有線設備的通信。 這相當於將多個工作站連接到公共集線器或交換機，並利用該網絡設備在工作站之間創建通信。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'WLAN Concepts(概念).html'}, {'title': 'Wireless Devices(無線設備)', 'text': 'As previously stated, most wireless networks utilize infrastructure mode and make use of a wireless router or wireless access point to connect the multitude of wireless devices in a given network. A wireless router is used in most small office/home office (SOHO) networks. These devices combine a router, a switch, and a wireless access point and serve as a base station and gateway for the wireless devices. The wireless router allows the wireless devices to communicate with each other using its wireless access point and switch functionality, and then uses its router functionality to connect devices to the remote network: in most cases, the Internet. The wireless router often combines multiple devices into a single, small device. These features include a wireless access point (WAP), a switch, a router, a firewall, and a modem (either cable, fiber, or DSL depending on the Internet service provider). \n Wireless access points, which are integrated into SOHO wireless routers, can also be purchased as standalone units. These are most often seen in corporate environments as part of an enterprise network. A wireless access point enables a wired LAN to communicate with a wireless LAN. The standalone WAP does not interconnect the two networks, though, since it is not a router. A WAP is simply a physical device that converts the radio frequency into 1s and 0s that are easily understood by the physical switch. Note that all wireless devices and the devices on the wired LAN are seen as a single subnet in a standard network. A WAP operates like a hub, broadcasting all the information it receives over the radio frequency waves and relying on the connected devices to only listen to their own traffic. \n \n Kyocera KR1 Mobile EV-DO router.

The freedom of Wi-Fi has become the infrastructure of choice and essentially relegated wired networks more to moving mass data traffic and less user traffic. Although it will not eliminate the wired infrastructure, because Wi-Fi access points need to connect to a wired device using the Ethernet standard, Wi-Fi allows greater expandability and access for IT departments in both corporate and SOHO environments. \n At the time when Wi-Fi became viable for implementation, the wired standard available in most corporate and SOHO networks operated at 100 Mbps. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Committee creates and maintains media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing WLAN computer communication. The IEEE 802.11 standard is overarching guidance that has been provided for the large number of wireless standards. The IEEE Wi-Fi standard is 802.11 with a small letter designation referring to the next revision (e.g., 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ad, etc.). Each standard (like 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n) is differentiated by the frequency range or frequency band that it utilizes. \n The 802.11 standard was initially ratified in 1997 and devices compliant with the 802.11a and 802.11b revisions became commercially available soon after in 2000. Despite higher throughput, 802.11a devices were not as readily adopted as 802.11b devices. At the time Wi-Fi became viable to deploy 802.11b at a maximum throughput of 11 Mbps, wired networks were at a minimum of 100 Mbps in most corporate and SOHO environments. The slower throughput kept users more reliant on traditional desktop machines and less likely to use their new wireless-capable laptops wirelessly. Once 802.11g was sufficiently saturated in the market, the disparity between its 54 Mbps speed and the 100 Mbps speed of wired networks became less noticeable and consumers became more interested in being wireless. The industry continued to push for ways to design higher throughput devices and incorporate the hardware into mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets, and lighter-weight laptops. \n Wireless LANs use two primary frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz range actually encompasses 2.4 to 2.5 GHz frequencies, while the 5 GHz range is 5.75 GHz to 5.875 GHz. Each frequency band has specific channels (or small portions of frequency) at which the devices operate to avoid overlapping with other wireless LAN devices. For 2.4 GHz frequency bands, it is important to choose channels 1, 6, and 11 to avoid overlapping frequencies. This is because overlapping can cause interference in your networks and cause data transmission and receiving issues for the devices. \n 無線（Wi-Fi）網絡速度，廣播流背後的技術以及無線安全性極大地改善了用戶連接性，進而增加了企業和SOHO網絡中諸如智能手機和平板電腦等多功能設備的使用。Wi-Fi的自由度已成為首選的基礎架構，從本質上講，降低了有線網絡的傳輸效率，使之可以移動海量數據流量而減少用戶流量。儘管不會消除有線基礎架構，但由於Wi-Fi接入點需要使用以太網標準連接到有線設備，因此Wi-Fi允許企業和SOHO環境中的IT部門具有更大的可擴展性和訪問權限。 \n Wi-Fi成為可行的實現之時，大多數公司和SOHO網絡中可用的有線標準以100 Mbps的速度運行。 電氣和電子工程師協會（IEEE）標準委員會創建並維護用於實現WLAN計算機通信的媒體訪問控制（MAC）和物理層（PHY）規範。 IEEE 802.11標準是為大量無線標準提供的總體指導。 IEEE Wi-Fi標準是802.11，帶有小寫字母，表示下一個修訂版本（例如802.11n，802.11ac，802.11ad等）。 每個標準（如802.11a，802.11b，802.11g或802.11n）都根據其使用的頻率範圍或頻帶進行區分。 \n 802.11標準最初是在1997年批准的，並且與802.11a和802.11b修訂版兼容的設備在2000年之後很快就可以商業化使用。儘管吞吐量更高，但是802.11a設備不如802.11b設備那樣容易採用。 當Wi-Fi能夠以11 Mbps的最大吞吐量部署802.11b時，在大多數公司和SOHO環境中，有線網絡的最低速度為100 Mbps。 較低的吞吐量使用戶更依賴於傳統台式機，並且不太可能無線使用其具有無線功能的新型筆記本電腦。 一旦802.11g在市場上充分飽和，其54 Mbps速度與100 Mbps有線網絡速度之間的差異就變得不那麼明顯了，消費者對無線變得越來越感興趣。 \n 無線局域網使用兩個主要頻段：2.4 GHz和5 GHz。 2.4 GHz範圍實際上包含2.4至2.5 GHz頻率，而5 GHz範圍是5.75 GHz至5.875 GHz。 每個頻帶具有設備在其上操作的特定信道（或頻率的一小部分），以避免與其他無線LAN設備重疊。 對於2.4 GHz頻帶，重要的是選擇信道1、6和11，以避免頻率重疊。 這是因為重疊會導致網絡干擾，並導致設備的數據傳輸和接收問題。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Background and History(背景和歷史).html'}, {'title': 'Speed, Range, and Frequencies(速度，範圍和頻率)', 'text': "\n \n Bandwidth speed has been greatly improved through the revisions after 802.11b, as shown in the table below. When discussing data flow and speed, the two terms referred to are bandwidth and throughput. Though they are often used interchangeably, the two terms are different and need to be understood. Simply put, bandwidth is the theoretical maximum of the given standard, whereas throughput is the actual potential in a real-world scenario. Many factors affect actual throughput, such as frequency, channel overlap, and broadcast streams. \n \n \n \n Revision \n (Max) Bandwidth \n Frequency \n \n \n 802.11a \n 54 Mbps \n 3.7/5.0 \n \n \n 802.11b \n 11 Mbps \n 2.4 \n \n \n 802.11g \n 54 Mbps \n 2.4 \n \n \n 802.11n \n 300/600 Mbps \n 2.4/5.0 \n \n \n 802.11ac \n 1700+ Gbps \n 5.0 \n \n \n \n The four wireless standards that are important to focus your studies on are 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps, and has a range of up to 35 meters indoors and 120 meters outdoors. 802.11b operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 11 Mbps, and has a range of up to 32 meters indoors and 140 meters outdoors. 802.11g operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, has a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps, and has a range of up to 32 meters indoors and 140 meters outdoors. 802.11n features a dual-band transceiver, operating in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, has a maximum bandwidth of more than 300 Mbps, and has a range of up to 70 meters indoors and 250 meters outdoors. \n The 2.4 GHz frequency band is more robust than the 5.0 GHz in that it is less susceptible to interference and has a wider distance range. However, many more devices such as RC toys, cordless telephones, other radio devices such as mice and keyboards, and microwave ovens also operate in the 2.4 GHz frequency, so it is more crowded, which can have a negative impact on throughput. Although the 5.0 GHz frequency band is less crowded, it is more susceptible to obstructions such as building infrastructure (i.e., walls, floors, steel beams, etc.) due to absorption. \n Beginning with the 802.11n standard and subsequently moving to the current 802.11ac standard, manufacturers incorporated multiple antennae to achieve higher throughput. Known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), both revisions accomplish the higher throughput by allowing operation at two different channel widths (20 and 40 MHz) within the same frequency and operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequency bands at the same time. Wireless N (802.11n) and wireless AC have a much larger bandwidth and maximum range, because they use MIMO and multiple frequency bands working in tandem to increase transmission and reception. \n An important note is that wireless N, G, and B are all compatible because they all support the 2.4 GHz frequency, allowing for backward compatibility. If you use multiple standards, like B, G, and N devices at the same time on a singular wireless N wireless access point, the WAP will default back to wireless B standards to support each device, which will significantly slow down the network. Wireless N and wireless A are compatible because they both use the 5 GHz frequency band. However, wireless A is \xa0 not \xa0 compatible with wireless B or G devices. \n \n \n \n learn by doing \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Which wireless standard operates at a maximum of 11 Mbps? \n \n 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g 802.11n \n \n \n \n Which wireless standard operates at a maximum of more than 300 Mbps with channel bonding? \n \n 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g 802.11n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n did I get this \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Drag and drop the items to match each standard with its frequency band, bandwidth, and range. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Standard \n Frequency Band \n Maximum Bandwidth \n Maximum Range \n \n \n 802.11a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 802.11b \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 802.11g \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 802.11n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 35 meters indoors, 120 meters outdoors \n 130−150 Mbps (more than 300 Mbps with channel bonding) \n 70 meters indoors, 250 meters outdoors \n \xa0 \n 5 GHz \n \xa0 \n 32 meters indoors, 140 meters outdoors \n 2.4 GHz \n \xa0 \n 32 meters indoors, 140 meters outdoors \n \xa0 \n 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz \n \xa0 \n 11 Mbps \n 54 Mbps \n \xa0 \n 54 Mbps \n \xa0 \n 2.4 GHz \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n did I get this \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n True or False: Using multiple standards — such as B, G, and N devices — at the same time on a single wireless N wireless access point will significantly slow down the network. \n \n True False \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n checkpoint \n \n \n \n \n Take a minute to stop and reflect on your progress for this learning objective. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Do you feel comfortable with this material and ready to move on? \n \n Yes, I feel confident in my ability to meet this learning objective.

There are many sources of interference in the 2.4 GHz range, which is one reason that wireless N and newer networks have switched to the 5 GHz frequency band. The frequency interference can be caused by other WLAN devices, such as having numerous WLANs in a single building and each WAP using the same channel or channels close in number (like channel 1 and 2, or 1 and 3). To prevent this, 2.4 GHz standard wireless devices should operate in channels separated by multiple channels, such as using channels 1, 6, and 11. \n Cordless phones, baby monitors, microwave ovens, wireless security systems, and other cordless electronics generally use the 2.4 GHz range, as well, so if you have many of those devices near your network, you may wish to upgrade to wireless N (5 GHz) to avoid interference. Physical obstacles, such as walls, appliances, cabinets, and other dense objects can also block the radio wave propagation, causing weak signals and network interference. Finally, the cause of interference could be that the originating signal is too weak, and some wireless access points allow you to increase the transmission power to overcome this type of interference. \n 由於其他設備使用與WLAN設備相同頻帶的頻率，因此無線網絡會受到射頻干擾（RFI）。在2.4 GHz範圍內有許多干擾源，這是無線N和較新網絡已切換到5 GHz頻帶的原因之一。頻率干擾可能是由其他WLAN設備引起的，例如在同一建築物中具有多個WLAN，並且每個WAP使用的通道數量相同（或通道1和2，或通道1和3）相同。為避免這種情況，2.4 GHz標準無線設備應在由多個通道分隔的通道中運行，例如使用通道1、6和11。 \n 無繩電話，嬰兒監視器，微波爐，無線安全系統和其他無繩電子設備通常也使用2.4 GHz範圍，因此，如果網絡中有許多此類設備，則可能希望升級到無線N（5 GHz ），以避免干擾。 牆壁，電器，機櫃和其他密集物體等物理障礙物也會阻擋無線電波的傳播，從而導致信號微弱和網絡干擾。 最後，造成乾擾的原因可能是始發信號太弱，某些無線接入點使您可以增加傳輸功率以克服這種類型的干擾。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Sources of Interference(干擾源).html'}, {'title': 'Privacy and Security(隱私和安全)', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Privacy and Security(隱私和安全).html'}, {'title': '1-1', 'text': '\n Due to the nature of Wi-Fi being transmitted through radio frequencies, the data transferred is susceptible to being viewed and captured by any other radio receiver. Encryption and network security have become a paramount concern for IT professionals at all levels.

This wireless connection was secured using encryption with a 40-bit WEP key that all access points and client devices would use (preshared key). This symmetric encryption was a good idea, but since the key was so small (40 bits), it was quickly broken by attackers. \n To solve this, WEP evolved into using a 64-bit key and could support keys up to 128 bits, which would provide strong encryption. Unfortunately, the WEP algorithm used for encryption also relied on using an initialization vector (IV) in combination with the preshared key to create the strong encryption, but the IV was only created at 24 bits and is sent in plain text or clear text during the preshared key exchange. This was quickly compromised by attackers using a brute-force attack to determine the password using the weak IV. Many utilities exist in the open-source realm that can crack WEP passwords within just a few minutes on modern hardware. For this reason, WEP is considered insecure today and should never be used in your networks. \n 在原始802.11標準中，唯一提供的安全性是WEP，它聲稱與有線網絡連接一樣安全。通過使用所有訪問點和客戶端設備都將使用的40位WEP密鑰（預共享密鑰）進行加密來保護此無線連接。這種對稱加密是一個好主意，但是由於密鑰很小（40位），因此攻擊者很快就將其破壞了。 \n 為了解決這個問題，WEP演變為使用64位密鑰，並且可以支持高達128位的密鑰，從而可以提供強大的加密功能。 不幸的是，用於加密的WEP算法還依賴於使用初始化向量（IV）結合預共享密鑰來創建強加密，但是IV僅以24位創建，並且在加密期間以純文本或明文發送。預共享密鑰交換。 攻擊者使用強力攻擊使用弱IV來確定密碼，從而很快破壞了這一安全性。 開源領域中存在許多實用程序，可以在短短幾分鐘內在現代硬件上破解WEP密碼。 因此，WEP在今天被認為是不安全的，永遠不要在您的網絡中使用。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) (有線等效保密（WEP）).html'}, {'title': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)(Wi-Fi保護訪問（WPA）)', 'text': 'The WPA standard was introduced to replace the insecure WEP. WPA used a 48-bit IV in place of WEP’s 24-bit IV. This upgraded IV uses a temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP). TKIP is an IEEE standard that was designed to provide more secure encryption. TKIP is a suite of algorithms that allows WLAN equipment to upgrade to TKIP without replacing hardware. TKIP encrypts each data packet with a unique encryption key, and the keys are much stronger than WEP. To increase key strength, TKIP includes four additional algorithms. \n In addition to TKIP, the WPA standard uses message integrity check (MIC) to confirm that data was not modified in transit. MIC uses a “hash” to verify that a message has not been altered. WPA supported both preshared key mode and enterprise mode. In enterprise mode, users are required to authenticate before exchanging their keys and each key between the client and access point is only temporary, reducing the chance of compromise. Unfortunately, WPA also suffered security flaws centered on the use of passphrases and pre-shared key (PSK) management and is now also considered to be unsecure. \n 引入了WPA標準來代替不安全的WEP。WPA使用48位IV代替WEP的24位IV。此升級的IV使用臨時密鑰完整性協議（TKIP）。TKIP是旨在提供更安全的加密的IEEE標準。TKIP是一套算法，可以使WLAN設備升級到TKIP，而無需更換硬件。TKIP使用唯一的加密密鑰加密每個數據包，並且該密鑰比WEP強得多。為了增強按鍵強度，TKIP包括四個附加算法。 \n 除了TKIP，WPA標準還使用消息完整性檢查（MIC）來確認數據在傳輸過程中沒有被修改。MIC使用“哈希”來驗證消息是否未被更改。WPA支持預共享密鑰模式和企業模式。在企業模式下，要求用戶在交換密鑰之前進行身份驗證，並且客戶端和訪問點之間的每個密鑰只是臨時的，從而減少了洩露的機會。不幸的是，WPA還遭受了圍繞密碼短語和預共享密鑰（PSK）管理的安全缺陷，現在也被認為是不安全的。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)(Wi-Fi保護訪問（WPA）).html'}, {'title': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)(Wi-Fi保護訪問2（WPA2）)', 'text': 'Wi-Fi protected access version 2 (WPA2) was implemented to replace both WEP and WPA because of the insecurities with the 24-bit and 48-bit initialization vectors.

Additionally, the encryption used for WPA2 is the advanced encryption standard (AES) with a 128-bit key, the same algorithm used by the United States government to protect their classified networks. Using WPA2 creates a secure wireless network, but only when used with good passwords and shared keys. WPA2 also supports enterprise mode for centralized user authentication (used in corporate networks) and a personal mode for preshared key support (used in most homes and small offices). The key to security with WPA2 is a strong password, since the current method of breaking into a WPA2 network is to use brute force attacks against the preshared key. If your key is long and complex, the attackers will not be able to penetrate your WPA2 wireless networks. \n 由於24位和48位初始化向量的不安全性，實施了Wi-Fi保護訪問版本2（WPA2）來替代WEP和WPA。 WPA2需要使用計數器模式（CCMP）和密碼塊鏈接消息身份驗證代碼協議進行更強的加密和完整性檢查，以進行完整性檢查。 此外，用於WPA2的加密是具有128位密鑰的高級加密標準（AES），與美國政府用於保護其機密網絡的算法相同。 使用WPA2可以創建安全的無線網絡，但前提是必須使用良好的密碼和共享密鑰。 WPA2還支持用於集中式用戶身份驗證的企業模式（用於公司網絡）和用於預共享密鑰支持的個人模式（用於大多數家庭和小型辦公室）。 使用WPA2進行安全保護的密鑰是一個強密碼，因為當前闖入WPA2網絡的方法是對預共享密鑰使用暴力攻擊。 如果密鑰又長又復雜，攻擊者將無法穿透您的WPA2無線網絡。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)(Wi-Fi保護訪問2（WPA2）).html'}, {'title': 'Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 Enterprise(Wi-Fi保護訪問2企業)', 'text': '\n \n WPA2 enterprise is a client/server model using the remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS) protocol found in larger corporate networks.
